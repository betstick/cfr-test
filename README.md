This is a test project to confirm and validate cfromreader. It's a mess.

The executable expects a DATA folder in the project root.
IE: cfr-test/DATA/

That DATA folder should contain stock DSPTDE files. Just what you'd get from a base install. You can also symlink if you wanna save space.

Example:
```
ln -s /home/user/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Dark\ Souls\ Prepare\ to\ Die\ Edition/DATA/ DATA
```
